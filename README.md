# React Todo App with API 
This React Todo App is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing tasks. The app is powered by an API client implemented in the './src/utils/fetchClient.ts' file, allowing seamless communication with the server using various methods.

## Error messages

In case of any error the notification is shown with an appropriate message at the bottom:

- the notification can be closed with the `close` button;
- the notification is automatically hidden after 3 seconds or before any next request.

## Filtering todos

Implemented filtering of todos by status `All` / `Active` / `Completed`.

## Adding a todo

Implemented adding:

- todo can be added with the entered title on the form submit with the help of POST request to the API;
- if the title is empty the `Title can't be empty` notification is shown at the bottom;
- the input is disabled until receiving a response from the API;
- immediately after sending a request a todo  is created with `id: 0` and saved  to the `tempTodo` variable in the state;
- temp TodoItem has the loader;
- in case of success the todo created by the API is added to the array;
- in case of an API error error notifications are shown.

## Deleting todos

Implemented deleting:

- the todo is removed on `TodoDeleteButton` click;
- the todo is covered with the loader while wating for the API response;
- in case of API error `Unable to delete a todo` is shown at the bottom;
- all the completed todos can be removed after the `Clear completed` button click.

## Toggling a todo status

Implemented toggling the `completed` status on `TodoStatus` change:

- covered the todo with a loader overlay while wating for API response;
- the status should is changed on success;
- `Unable to update a todo` notification is shown in case of API error.

Added the ability to toggle the completed status of all the todos with the `toggleAll` checkbox:

- `toggleAll` button has `active` class only if all the todos are completed;
- `toggleAll` click changes its status to the oppsite one, and sets it to all the todos.

## Renaming a todo

Implemented the ability to edit a todo title on double click:

- the edit form is shown instead of the title and remove button;
- changes can be saved on the form submit (press `Enter`);
- if new title is the same as the old one editing is cancelled;
- editing is cancelled on `Es—Å` key;
- if the new title is empty, todo gets deleted;
- if the title is changed, the loader works while waiting for the API response;
- `Unable to update a todo` is shown in case of API error.
